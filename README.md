## 👋 Hi, I’m Bruno (@vbsamuel)

### Low-level systems, high-level logic.

🔧 **What I Work On**

I build and study systems at the intersection of:

- Distributed and heterogeneous compute
- Event-based messaging and time-series coordination
- Systems-level concurrency, orchestration, and determinism
- Symbolic and sub-symbolic processing layers
- Mixed input/output interfaces (spatial, sensory, contextual)

I'm interested in the underlying mechanics of inference, memory, and scheduling... especially how distributed components can maintain coherent state across noisy, asynchronous environments...

📎 **Current Technical Focus**

- **Event Graphs** temporal dependency resolution and signal propagation across compute clusters  
- **Function Scheduling** interrupt-driven synchronization and context-local memory coordination  
- **Inference Routing** parallel dataflow compilation across CPU/GPU/NPU fabrics  
- **Abstraction Layers** composable runtime interfaces for cross-domain semantic systems  
- **Spatial Computing** bridging physical-digital boundaries through minimal-UI feedback loops

🛠 **Projects/Experiments**

Some personal work often involves:

- Writing minimal runtime schedulers and graph compilers  
- Exploring causal memory models for distributed systems  
- Encoding knowledge transforms using pipelines instead of static models  
- Instrumenting I/O pathways in real-world environments (spatial, sensory, reactive)
- Recursive deletes and development environment set-ups...

🤝 **Looking to Collaborate With**

- Engineers who care about latency, determinism, and state  
- Builders of protocol-level coordination systems  
- Mathematically inclined systems designers
